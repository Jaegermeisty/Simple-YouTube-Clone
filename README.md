# YouTube Clone

This project is a simple YouTube Clone created for practice purposes. While I already had a good understanding of the concepts used, I worked on this project to reinforce my skills and possibly learn something new or revisit forgotten techniques.

## Inspiration
This project was built by following the tutorial from **SuperSimpleDev** on YouTube:
[Building a YouTube Clone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&t=13424s). 

The tutorial provided a step-by-step guide, but I customized and implemented the code while ensuring I fully understood each part.

## Features
- **Responsive Header**: Includes a search bar, logo, and icons for user interaction.
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Contains links to navigate different sections.
- **Video Grid**: Displays videos in a responsive grid format with thumbnails, titles, and author details.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (organized into modular files like `general.css`, `header.css`, `sidebar.css`, and `video.css`)

## Motivation
This project was completed to:
1. Practice and consolidate web development concepts.
2. Identify and fill any knowledge gaps.
3. Enhance my familiarity with building responsive layouts and modular CSS structures.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the project.

## Credits
Special thanks to **SuperSimpleDev** for the comprehensive tutorial that inspired and guided this project!
